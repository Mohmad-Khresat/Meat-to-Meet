      <h1>MEAT to MEET</h1>
      <p>Our story began in the state of Vermont with fellow name Schwandt who had a small farm in Wolcott who worked during the day and rested in the night he was a kind and bright 
        he gave people treats and mourned for the deceased but one day when he was waiting for some people to greet he had an idea while waiting in the street
         why do we always meet to eat he asked while stomping his feet how do you mean people asked while
         intrigued every day and night he answered we feast tighten his teeth we should be sweet to those who have goals to beat you are right said a man name dilpreet we shall start tonight and from that night 
         forward Schwandt and dilpreet harvest the wheat and cut the meet so those with white plates can eat</p>
