        <h3>FILET MIGNON</h3>
        <p>
          Since there’s very little marbling and not a lot of fat or connective tissue inside the filet, 
          it’s arguably the most tender of all high-end cuts of beef. 
          We add our special 28-day aging process to further its flavor and tenderness.

        <h3>CHEESEBURGER</h3>
        <p>
          Our simple, classic cheeseburger begins with a 100% pure beef patty 
          seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper. It's topped with a tangy pickle, 
          chopped onions, ketchup, mustard, and a slice of melty American cheese.
